In 2005 Franz et al. made an exploratory study of the geometric qualities of empty architectural spaces using a virtual-reality based experiment. Their results showed that virtual reality simulations provide sufficient psychophysical data to perform basic architectural research.

Their focus was on exploring the emotional responses of participants to the spatial qualities of different rooms. Seeking to quantify the architectural stimuli which creates intersubjective patterns of feelings within observers, they found very few systematic investigations between physical structures and experienced architectural spaces.
