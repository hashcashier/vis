Footprints, tiretracks and beaten paths are clear indicators of the routes people take everyday. In urban areas, where mostly pavement and concrete cover the roads, there aren't any clear traces of people's treading habits. In this project, we have developed a system that uses augmented reality (AR) glasses to display virtual motion traces to its users and analyzed how different visualizations of these motion traces affect the users' walking patterns.
