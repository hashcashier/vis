\chapter{Methodology}

In this chapter the implementation of the system, to be used to carry out the main user study, is explained in detail. The system is broken down into two main components: the tracking component that infers the 3D position of the user in-loco, and the simulation component which presents shape-changing architectural plans to the user in a virtual reality environment. The two components are explained in their own sections, followed by a brief section about how they were merged together to provide an immersive simulation.
